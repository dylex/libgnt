This file is intended to be a comprehensive list of contributors to
this project.  If you have contributed to this project then you deserve
to be on this list.  Contact us (see: AUTHORS) and we'll add you.

Many open source projects list contributor names at the top of each
source file containing their contribution.  However, we've found
that it is difficult to keep this list accurate, especially when old
code is removed or existing code is moved to a different file.  So
instead we chose to list a generic message at the top of each source
file that points here.

If concerns are raised as to the copyright holder of a particular
piece of code, then that code should be traced through our version
control system to see from where it came and who has modified it.
